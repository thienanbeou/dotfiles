Dotfiles I'm currently using on my Linux machine, using **Hyprland**, **Kitty**, **Fish**, **Waybar**, and other lightweight tools. 
This setup is tuned for simplicity, with a bit of eye candy for a more pleasant experience.

I occasionally fall back to **XFCE** when something breaks in Hyprland or when certain apps don't behave correctly.
